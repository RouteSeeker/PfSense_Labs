# pfSense Lab 2: Setting Up OpenVPN and Routing Traffic Through a VPN Service

## Introduction  
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!  

Welcome to **Lab 2** of my **pfSense Firewall** series. As promised, this week I will be diving into **OpenVPN**, specifically routing all the traffic through a VPN service. Using a VPN service is crucial for securing and anonymizing your internet traffic. It ensures that your data remains encrypted, even when using public networks like Wi-Fi, protecting your sensitive information from hackers. Additionally, VPNs are an excellent tool for maintaining privacy and anonymity online by masking your IP address and making it more challenging for third parties to track your online activity.

Furthermore, using a VPN allows you to access content or services that may be region-restricted. For example, by connecting to a server in a different country, you can bypass geo-blocks to access websites, streaming platforms, or services that would otherwise be unavailable in your region. VPN services can also provide enhanced security for businesses, allowing remote employees to securely connect to the company network as if they were physically present in the office.

For this lab, Iâ€™ll be using **Surfshark** as my VPN provider, as I currently have a subscription with them. I went ahead and downloaded the configuration file for the **South Africa** region, which is where I want to route my traffic through. Letâ€™s get started with the configuration!

## Configuring OpenVPN on pfSense  

### Step 1: Accessing pfSense and Adding a Certificate Authority  
After logging into my pfSense firewall, I navigated to **System > Certificate> Authorities** and clicked on the **+ Add** button on the right-hand side.

Next, I filled in the fields for the **Descriptive Name**, and under the **Method** section, I chose **Import an existing Certificate Authority**. I then pasted the certificate data I got from the Surfshark config file I downloaded and clicked **Save**.

### Step 2: Adding an OpenVPN Client  
I then navigated to **VPN > OpenVPN > Clients** and clicked the **+ Add** button on the right-hand side.  

![Open VPN](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/PfSense_Labs/blob/main/Assets/Screenshots/02.OpenVPN_Client/04.Add_VPN_Client.png) 

For the endpoint configuration, I inserted the server host or address from the Surfshark config file, along with a description of the connection, leaving the rest of the settings at their default values.

---

### Step 3: User Authentication  
Under the **User Authentication** section, I entered the credentials provided by Surfshark. These credentials are necessary to authenticate the VPN connection.

### Step 4: Configuring Cryptographic Settings  
In the **Cryptographic Settings** section, I checked the **Use a TLS Key** box and unchecked **Automatically generate a TLS Key**. This action prompted the appearance of the **TLS Key Comment** box, where I navigated to the **Begin OpenVPN Static Key V1** section in the Surfshark config file and pasted the TLS key information.

The **Peer Certificate Authority** should be the same as the one we originally set up earlier.  

![Cryptographic Settings](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/PfSense_Labs/blob/main/Assets/Screenshots/02.OpenVPN_Client/07.Cryptographic_Settings.png)  

Next, I included the **Data Encryption Algorithm** and **Auth Digest Algorithm** based on the details from the configuration file and left the rest as default.

### Step 5: Advanced Configuration  
I then left the **Tunnel Settings** options as default. In the **Advanced Configuration** section, I added the following code:

```
tls-client;
remote-random;
tun-mtu 1500;
tun-mtu-extra 32;
mssfix 1450;
persist-key;
persist-tun;
reneg-sec 0;
remote-cert-tls server;
```
## Hereâ€™s What Each Command Does:

- **`tls-client`**: Specifies that this is a TLS client connection.  
- **`remote-random`**: Ensures that a random remote server is selected when multiple servers are available.  
- **`tun-mtu 1500`**: Sets the MTU size for the tunnel interface to 1500 bytes.  
- **`tun-mtu-extra 32`**: Allows for extra space for IP headers, preventing fragmentation.  
- **`mssfix 1450`**: Fixes issues with Maximum Segment Size for tunneling.  
- **`persist-key`**: Keeps the key in memory after the session is renegotiated.  
- **`persist-tun`**: Ensures the tunnel remains open after a key renewal.  
- **`reneg-sec 0`**: Disables the key renegotiation interval.  
- **`remote-cert-tls server`**: Ensures the server certificate is verified when establishing the connection.  

I selected **IPv4 Only** for the gateway creation and set the verbosity level to **3**, then clicked **Save**.

## Step 6: Interface Assignment and DNS Resolver Configuration  

Navigate to **Interfaces > Interface Assignments**, then add **SurfVPN**.  

![Interface Assignments](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/PfSense_Labs/blob/main/Assets/Screenshots/02.OpenVPN_Client/11.Interface_assignments.png)  

Next, click on the newly created interface and enable it. Change its name to **SurfVPN** and save the settings at the bottom.  

![Enabling Interface](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/PfSense_Labs/blob/main/Assets/Screenshots/02.OpenVPN_Client/12.Enabling_Interface.png)

Then, go to **Services > DNS Resolver > General Settings** and enable the DNS Resolver. Select **SurfVPN** as the outgoing network interface to ensure DNS queries are routed through the VPN.

## Step 7: Configuring Outbound NAT  

Navigate to **Firewall > NAT > Outbound**, select **Manual Outbound NAT**, and click **Save**. pfSense will automatically add four NAT rules for the **SurfVPN** interface. Add a new rule, selecting **Network or Alias** as the source and specifying the network to pass through the VPN.  

![Outbound NAT](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/PfSense_Labs/blob/main/Assets/Screenshots/02.OpenVPN_Client/14.Outbound_NAT.png)

Then, select **Hide Advanced Options** under **Extra Options**.

![Display Advanced](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/PfSense_Labs/blob/main/Assets/Screenshots/02.OpenVPN_Client/16.Display_Advanced.png)

## Step 8: Configuring Firewall Rules for LAN  

Go to **Firewall > Rules > LAN** and edit the existing IPv4 rule. Under the **Gateway** section, select the **SurfVPN gateway** you created earlier.

---

## Step 9: Verifying the VPN Connection  

Finally, navigate to **Status > OpenVPN** to confirm that the OpenVPN service is running correctly.

## Conclusion  

With that, Iâ€™ve successfully set up **OpenVPN** on pfSense and routed all traffic through the VPN service. This setup ensures that my traffic is encrypted and secure while using the internet, and any geo-restricted content can be accessed by routing traffic through a specific region (**South Africa** in this case).  

Throughout this lab, we learned about configuring OpenVPN, setting up TLS keys, using advanced configuration options, and routing traffic through a VPN gateway. In the next lab, weâ€™ll explore more pfSense features, so stay tuned for further enhancements to this setup!
