# pfSense Lab 1: Initial Setup, DMZ Configuration, and Firewall Rules  

## Introduction  
ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!  

Originally, I planned to kick off this lab series after completing my Palo Alto series. However, I ran into persistent issues setting up the Palo Alto firewall on VMware and GNS3 due to an error preventing the initial configuration. As a result, I decided to start with pfSense insteadâ€”and honestly, itâ€™s a fantastic choice.  

pfSense is an open-source firewall and router that provides enterprise-level features for free. Its versatility, ease of setup, and ability to run on modest hardware make it ideal for learning network security. Itâ€™s also widely used in both home labs and production environments, offering great insights into firewall management.  

In this journal, Iâ€™ll walk through:  
- The **initial setup wizard** for pfSense.  
- Configuring a **DMZ LAN** network.  
- Creating **firewall rules** for WAN and DMZ.  

Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸš€

## Network Setup

### Installing pfSense on VMware  
I downloaded the VMware ISO for pfSense and installed it using VMware Workstation 7. The installation was smooth and painless, and within minutes, I was ready to begin the initial configuration.  

### Setting Up the Network Interfaces  
For this lab:  
- **WAN Interface (em0):** Simulated as `192.168.100.15` 
- **LAN Interface (em1):** Simulated as `10.2.0.1`.

### Accessing the Web Portal  
To start the configuration, I spun up a Linux instance and logged into the pfSense web portal using the default credentials (`admin:pfsense`). The portal greeted me with the **Setup Wizard**, which simplifies the initial configuration.

#### General Information  
On the general information page:  
- I left the hostname as `pfsense`, but you can customize it.  
- For the domain name, I used `rseeker.arpa` as itâ€™s internal.  
- I set the **Primary DNS** to Cloudflareâ€™s `1.1.1.1` and the **Secondary DNS** to Googleâ€™s `8.8.8.8`.  
- The **"Override DNS"** option was unchecked to ensure pfSense doesnâ€™t override the manually configured DNS servers. This is important because enabling it could cause DNS queries to rely on the WAN ISP, potentially exposing sensitive internal queries.

#### WAN Interface  
At the bottom of the page, I unchecked:  
- **Block RFC1918 Private Networks**  
- **Block Bogon Networks**  

These options are typically enabled to prevent private IPs and bogon traffic on WAN. Since my WAN is on a private network, disabling them prevents unintended blocking. For public WANs, keeping these enabled is recommended.

#### Admin WebGUI Password  
Next, I set a strong password for the Admin WebGUI. Remember, using a complex password protects against unauthorized access.

After finishing the wizard, I clicked **Finish** and rebooted the firewall to apply the new configuration.

## Configuring the DMZ  

### Enabling the DMZ Interface  
Once rebooted, I logged back in and enabled the **DMZ interface**.  
- I set the **Configuration Type** to IPv4.  
- Assigned the DMZ network as `172.16.0.1/24`.

### Setting Up DHCP on the DMZ  
I configured a DHCP server for the DMZ network, assigning a pool range of `172.16.0.100` to `172.16.0.150`. This ensures devices in the DMZ get IPs automatically.

## Firewall Rules  

### Creating an Alias  
To simplify firewall management, I created an alias named **RemoteMGMT** for ports `22` and `80`. In pfSense, aliases act as reusable objects, allowing you to group IPs, ports, or networks. This reduces redundancy when creating multiple rules.  

Aliases save time and minimize errors by consolidating similar rules into one manageable entity. For example, instead of defining SSH and HTTP access separately, I used **RemoteMGMT** to allow both in one rule.

### Configuring WAN Rules for Remote Access  
I added a firewall rule under **WAN** to allow **TCP** traffic from `192.168.10.10` (simulating an external IP) to the alias **RemoteMGMT**. This setup lets specific external IPs remotely manage the firewall while blocking others, enhancing security.

### DMZ Firewall Rules  
For the DMZ, I created a rule to allow only **HTTP (port 80)** access from the internet. This restricts unnecessary exposure of services, keeping the DMZ more secure.

### Blocking DMZ-to-LAN Traffic  
To isolate the LAN from the DMZ, I added a rule to block all traffic from the DMZ to the LAN. This ensures that if the DMZ is compromised, attackers canâ€™t access critical LAN resources.

## Destination NAT (Port Forwarding)  
Since the DMZ uses internal IPs, I set up **Destination NAT** to forward requests from the public WAN IP to the internal DMZ IP (`192.168.50.10`). This enables external users to access the DMZ web server securely.

## LAN Firewall Rules  
I left the default LAN rules unchanged. Itâ€™s better to monitor traffic and block unused ports gradually rather than restricting everything upfront. This approach reduces troubleshooting headaches while fine-tuning security.

## Conclusion  
This was an exciting start to my pfSense lab series. The setup wizard and initial configurations provided a solid foundation, and configuring the DMZ, firewall rules, and NAT further enhanced the setup.
